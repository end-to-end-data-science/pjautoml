In 2018 Edesio Alcobaça started his doctorate in Computer Science. With the
help of their advisor André Carvalho, they began to propose an end-to-end
AutoML in order to encompass several steps of machine learning and data mining.

In mid-2019, Edesio presented these proposals to Davi Pereira dos Santos, who
also started working with them.

Together we think and develop tools to do end to end data science. We developed
some interesting ideas, such as: structuring the search space in trees/graphs,
minimal components for AutoML, how to treat data and its transformations during
the construction of the pipeline, how to represent End-to-End AutoML
mathematically, visualization of data and models, ways to show results and
machine learning models, reproducibility, scalability, and robustness. Many of
these things are here, but others stayed in our minds.

Davi cut out a stable version of this repository and made it available to our
lab colleagues. That is the curumim-automl-sandbox repository
(https://github.com/end-to-end-data-science/curumim-automl-sandbox).

We decided at the end of 2019 to divide this repository into a series of other
repositories under the End to End Data Science
(https://github.com/end-to-end-data-science) organization, to maintain the
better-organized code.
